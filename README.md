# IP_visualize
Repository for visualizing Image processing tools and algorithms.

After running it will output a GIF of each step in the process

currently avilable visualizations : 
* 2D Convolution


## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

run the following command in your terminal / command line

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### How to run

in `run.py` you have an example of running the currently avilable implementations and the output dir the GIF will be saved.

## Examples 

### 2D Convolution

** 7x7 Image, 2x2 Kernel , Padding=0 , strides = 1 **

![7x7 image with 2x2 kernel padding=0 strides=1](https://github.com/eranns/IP_visualize/blob/master/examples/7x7_2x2_padding0_strides1.gif)



## Contribution

I would like to get more algorithms in this repository, feel free to make a PR and follow the Stateful and GIFable abstract classes.
